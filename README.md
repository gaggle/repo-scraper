# repo-scraper [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gaggle/repo-scraper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gaggle/repo-scraper) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)
Scrape GitHub repository data, to be consumed by [repo-lister][repo-lister].

In principle the scraper supports multiple repository providers, but only GitHub is supported at the moment. Let me know if you'd like others. There's a [WIP PR to test GitLab integration][gl-pr] if that's interesting?


## Development
* `npm test` for tests and coverage
